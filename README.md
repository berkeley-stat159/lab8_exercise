# Matplotlib Breakout

**Credit** This exercise is modified from an exercise assigned in the Spring
2012 session of AY 250 taught by Joshua Bloom et al.

## Goal

The goal of this breakout is to *exactly* replicate (minus differences due to 
full-screen aspect ratios) the following image with `matplotlib`:

![Replicate Me](stocks_and_temp.png)

The data for the exercise are contained in the data folder. Note that the dates
for the data are all stored in Modified Julian Date (MJD) format. You will need
to convert this to a numpy datetime object (**HINT**: you might want to search
GitHub for projects that convert from MJD-to-date rather than implement the
conversion yourself!).

Check out the [matplotlib gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) for info
on how to achieve this goal.
